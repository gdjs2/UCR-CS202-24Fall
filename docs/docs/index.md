# CS202 - Advanced Operating System - Lab Session - 24 Fall

## Basic Info

HiðŸ‘‹, welcome to the course page for *CS202 Advanced Operating System, Fall 2024* for UC Riverside, whose lecture is hosted by Prof. [Heng Yin](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~heng/). The laboratory section would be hosted by me, Zhaoqi Xiao. 

Although we do not have an official **Lab Session**, you can try getting most of the help you need to complete your project from this website as well as addition documents provided here, or, from office hours. 

BTW, the time for my **office hours** would be:

* Monday 2pm - 4pm @ [Zoom](https://ucr.zoom.us/j/91841068999?pwd=pgoHm11EtQ1nvmz70sfpQBTUJEDTam.1)
* Or @ WCH 110 by appointment with [email](mailto:zxiao033@ucr.edu)

## The Composition of Laboratory Session

We will have **three** projects in total for the Lab Session:

1. [System Call Implementation](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~heng/teaching/cs202-fall24/lab1.pdf)
2. [Modifying the Scheduler](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~heng/teaching/cs202-fall24/lab2.pdf)
3. [Threads](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~heng/teaching/cs202-fall24/lab3.pdf)

Prior to (or some time after) each Lab release, I would publish an instruction to help you get start with.
